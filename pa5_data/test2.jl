Investigators said that engineering decisions eroded the safety margin in an attempt to cut costs. But the technology wasn\u2019t as robust as engineers thought it was. Even more humbling was the March 11 earthquake in Japan. The earthquake wasn\u2019t supposed to be possible. The seismic hazard maps showed that the maximum possible earthquake along the Japan Trench \u2014 the huge fault line where one plate of the Earth dives beneath another \u2014 could generate earthquakes up to magnitude 8.4. But on the afternoon of March 11, the fault broke and generated an earthquake registering 9.0, which was six times stronger than the theoretical maximum. That misunderstanding of the quake hazard led to a fundamental error in the design of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant built on the seacoast. The plant was protected by a tsunami wall that could handle waves up to 18.7 feet high. The first wave after the earthquake was 13 feet high, and the second was so much bigger that it obliterated the tide gauge used to measure wave height. The biggest wave may have been as high as 49 feet, according to an investigation by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations. The tsunami knocked out the backup power generators at the", "default_text": [[" A number of recent events have shown that complex technological systems are vulnerable to rare but consequential failures .
